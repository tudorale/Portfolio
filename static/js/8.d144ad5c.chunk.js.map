I used mainly React JS as the best option as the client was fine with it, I used also different libraries such as GSAP, AOS, Typed.js for animations. The illustrations from the landing page were edited in Adobe Photoshop to match the color scheme.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <div className=\"imageWrapper\">\r\n                <img alt=\"\" src={ImageOne} />\r\n                <h1>Hero section, with an interactiv demo from the product.</h1>\r\n            </div>\r\n\r\n            <h3 className=\"special\">What was my role on this project?</h3>\r\n            <p>As the recruiter for this one time project wanted a Front-End Developer, with experience in React JS, I handled the coding of the landing page but also the design of it.</p>\r\n            <h3>What technologies I used?</h3>\r\n            <p>For the coding process I used <span>React JS</span> with the following libraries: <span>GSAP</span>, <span>AOS</span>, <span>React Slick</span> and <span>Typed JS</span>.</p>\r\n            <p>To design the wireframe and a mockup for the landing page I used <span>Figma</span>.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p></p>\r\n\r\n            <div className=\"imageWrapper\">\r\n                <img alt=\"\" src={ImageTwo} />\r\n                <h1>Section two, about the first feature, along with a carousel with videos.</h1>\r\n            </div>\r\n\r\n            <h3 className=\"special\">A walkthrough my process</h3>\r\n            <p>The project started with a wireframe made in Figma, after the client review it, I started adding more features, illustrations and icons to make the design look better.
